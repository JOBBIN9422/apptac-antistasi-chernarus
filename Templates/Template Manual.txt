Hi! And welcome to the template folder.
This folder contains ALL of the units and vehicles that are recognized and used by the mission.
The template names follow a common structure: Modset _ Side(mission logic [Rebel, Occupant, Invader]) _ Side(name, e.g. NATO) _ Environment (or map for vanilla as each one will have dlc dependancies)

To see how the various files should be made, look at the files in the Example folder.

Integrated mods should be detected in the same way as any other in detector.sqf

Templates should be selected in the same way as any other in selector.sqf, also make sure you add the call to your JNL nodes file.
